(276, 23, 'Hacks for When You Forget to Wear Your Pedometer', '1648544130watch.jpg', 'There are times when your pedometer step count doesn\'t accurately reflect the number you of steps you\'ve taken throughout the day. Maybe you left your pedometer at home, the battery is dead, or you\'ve been pushing a stroller and your device didn\'t log any movements because your arms were steady.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you love the habit and accountability that fitness trackers offer, you may be frustrated that you don\'t have a record of your steps. But there are ways to make up for lost miles, even while sitting down.\r\n\r\nHow to Add Steps to a Fitness Tracker\r\nWhen you know you\'ve put in the effort, you can tap into different methods—some practical, some surprising—to retroactively add those steps that were not recorded. Keep in mind that fitness trackers like Fitbit claim to have a multi-faceted way of collecting data to determine steps including your duration, intensity, and movement pattern. While these are recommended fixes, results can vary and you may need to experiment.\r\n\r\nUse Your Phone\r\nYou can use your smartphone to access step count data. In some situations, your tracker app can use smartphone data to bolster step counts recorded by the tracker.\r\n\r\nFor example, In the Fitbit app, you can add Fitbit MobileTrack as a device. This will allow the app to use your phone\'s built-in accelerometer chip and display its data. Go to Account, Set Up Device, and select MobileTrack. Other brands of fitness trackers may have a similar feature.\r\n\r\nLog Steps as Exercise\r\nFitbit and some other trackers let you manually log exercise that wasn\'t recorded. You can add your \"lost\" steps as a workout. This tactic may or may not add to your step count total. It does with Fitbit for some purposes but won\'t transfer to some third-party applications where you may be engaged in competitions or earning rewards. You may want to estimate the missing steps by knowing your steps per mile.\r\n\r\n\r\nTry Another Activity\r\nA few more miles will likely benefit you unless you just finished a long-distance training walk or an actual marathon. If you\'re tired of walking, you can turn on your tracker, play music, and dance.1 Arm and hip motion can rack up steps quickly. Even simply tapping your feet can yield results.\r\n\r\n\r\nCycling is another great option because it works similar muscles without any impact. Not all pedometers and fitness bands count cycling motion as steps, so try positioning the pedometer on your sock cuff if you don\'t get steps with it on your shoe.\r\n\r\n\r\n Biking Your Way to Weight Loss\r\nMove Your Arms\r\nMany fitness bands can be tricked into recording lots of steps if you use vigorous arm motion. Even knitting or wrapping a string around your pedometer and swinging it back and forth have reportedly worked. These methods can be helpful if your legs are sore from your walk.\r\n\r\n How to Recover After a Long Walk\r\nGet Help From Friends and Family\r\nYou may be tired, but maybe somebody else is ready to get moving. Attach your pedometer to your little one as he or she goes to soccer or basketball practice.2 Offer a reward for logging the most steps while jumping rope, shooting hoops, playing Xbox, Just Dance, Beat Saber (virtual reality game), or making TikTok dances. These are all great things for your kids to be doing for their own physical activity.\r\n\r\nYou can also let older friends and family offer assistance. Hand your tracker over to a friend or loved one who is ready to walk, run, or get on the treadmill. They\'ll get some exercise and you\'ll get the steps.\r\n\r\nPlay With Your Dog\r\nAttach your pedometer to your dog\'s collar and play catch.3\r\n\r\n﻿ It won\'t wear you out if you have your dog return the ball to you with each throw. Your device may not count your pup\'s steps the same as human, but it might get you closer to your lost step number.\r\n\r\n The 4 Best Dog Pedometers to Track Your Pet\'s Activity\r\nUse a Motorized Device\r\nWhat gadgets or appliances do you have that might simulate a walking motion so you don\'t have to? Ceiling fans, metronomes, and power drills have all been reportedly used to increase the number of steps, though some devices offer mixed results.\r\n\r\nOne person even reported accidentally dropping hers in the dryer, which resulted in an uptick of steps. (If you try this, make sure to wrap your tracker with padding in a zippered pouch or pocket and set the dryer to the no-heat air-dry setting.)\r\n\r\nA Word From Verywell\r\nIt\'s great to be motivated by your fitness tracker and make your activity goal each day, but it does bring the risk of being demotivated when it doesn\'t record all of your efforts. If you aren\'t able to make your goal for the day, it\'s important to get past that disappointment and continue to be active each day.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that some studies have shown the inaccuracies in these monitors.4 Ultimately, whether or not you use your fitness tracker, the goal is to move more, sit less, and achieve the minimum recommended amount of exercise each day.', '0', '2022-03-29 08:55:30', NULL),

From following a healthy diet plan to working out regime, those who want to lose weight leave no stone unturned to get a fitter body. But often, we miss on some basic yet important things which might also impact our weight loss journey. Here we have mentioned a few important things that must be followed to maintain a healthy body weight.\r\nRead Also\r\n\r\nWeight Loss Tips: 10 foods that you should avoid if you want to lose weight\r\nRead Also\r\n\r\nQuick Weight Loss: GM diet plan can help you lose 5 to 7 kgs in 7 days\r\nAvoid skipping meals: It’s important to follow a sensible weight loss journey. Skipping meals will not help in losing weight but it may impact your physical and mental wellbeing. Also, when you skip meals, you might end up eating more. Remember, when you are hungry, you’re less likely to make healthy food choices.\r\nDon’t expect quicker results: It is rightly said that gaining weight is easier than losing weight. It needs a lot of determination and willpower to follow a healthy lifestyle. On reaching a weight loss plateau, you might feel demotivated. And, this is the point which might break or make your weight loss plan successful.\r\nPortion eating: Instead of eliminating your favourite foods from your diet, indulge in portion eating. This is the best practice to maintain a dietary balance.\r\nBreakfast is important: Breakfast is the most important meal of the day and should never be skipped. Increase protein intake in your breakfast meal as it will help you stay fuller for a longer duration.\r\nEat sufficient: Eating less may not be the perfect solution to lose weight, instead it backfires in most cases. Hence, it’s important to know the number of calories required by your body. Get proper information about what all nutrients you must eat for a healthy living.\r\nGrocery shopping on full stomach: This is the secret to a healthier body. Whenever you go for grocery shopping, go on a full stomach. This trick will help you to choose healthy fruits and vegetables and you will not crave for processed and junk food. And you will end up eating a healthy diet.\r\nEat slowly: Eating slowly will help in proper digestion of food. Also, when you savour your food, you are less likely to indulge in overeating.\r\nCook your own food: This is another secret of healthy eating. When you cook your own food, you are more likely to fix a healthy meal.\r\nSleep properly: Sleep properly. Avoid any distraction as it may interrupt your sound sleep and you might feel cranky, lethargic and distracted the following day. Sound sleep will also help you to stay active throughout the day.\r\nWalk more often: This is a basic yet important tip. Instead of using elevators and escalators, use stairs. If you have a sedentary job, get up after every two hours and take a five to ten-minute walk.\r\nStay hydrated: Staying well hydrated is another key to a healthy weight. You must know how much water your body requires. Drink accordingly and don’t let your body stay dehydrated.\r\nMake a day’s eating plan: This may sound like a task but following it is worth a healthy life. Make a plan for the following day and stick to your eating plan.\r\nUse small plates: Even researchers have proved that when you eat in a small plate, you tend to eat less. Avoid eating in bigger plates as you might eat more.\r\nTreat yourself: Cheat days are important but remember don’t overindulge. Even on your cheat days, make a smart eating choice.\r\nSay no to frying: Fried foods are the main culprits of weight problems and obesity. They do no good but only harm your health. Try to eliminate fried food from your diet and you will see faster and effective weight loss results.', '0', '2022-03-29 08:59:01', '2022-03-29 12:42:23'),

A simple way to create a meal plan is to make sure that each meal consists of 50 percent fruit and vegetables, 25 percent whole grains, and 25 percent protein. Total fiber intake should be 25–30 gramsTrusted Source (g) daily.\r\n\r\nEliminate trans fats from the diet, and minimize the intake of saturated fats, which has a strong link with the incidence of coronary heart disease.\r\n\r\nInstead, people can consume monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) or polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), which are types of unsaturated fat.\r\n\r\nThe following foods are healthful and often rich in nutrients:\r\n\r\n- fresh fruits and vegetables\r\n-  fish\r\n- legumes\r\n- nuts\r\n- seeds\r\n-whole grains, such as brown rice and oatmeal\r\n\r\nFoods to avoid eating include:\r\n\r\n- foods with added oils, butter, and sugar\r\n- fatty red or processed meats\r\n- baked goods\r\n- bagels\r\n- white bread\r\n- processed foods\r\n\r\nIn some cases, removing certain foods from the diet might cause a person to become deficient in some necessary vitamins and minerals. A nutritionist, dietitian, or another healthcare professional can advise a person how to get enough nutrients while they are following a weight loss program.\r\n\r\n2. Keep a food and weight diary\r\n\r\nSelf-monitoring is a critical factor in successfully losing weight. People can use a paper diary, mobile app, or dedicated website to record every item of food that they consume each day. They can also measure their progress by recording their weight on a weekly basis.\r\n\r\nThose who can track their success in small increments and identify physical changes are much more likely to stick to a weight loss regimen.\r\n\r\nPeople can also keep track of their body mass index (BMI) using a BMI calculator.\r\n\r\n3. Engage in regular physical activity and exercise\r\n\r\nRegular physical activity can help a person lose weight.\r\nRegular exercise is vital for both physical and mental health. Increasing the frequency of physical activity in a disciplined and purposeful way is often crucial for successful weight loss.\r\n\r\nOne hour of moderate-intensity activity per day, such as brisk walking, is ideal. If one hour per day is not possible, the Mayo Clinic suggests that a person should aim for a minimum of 150 minutes every week.\r\n\r\nPeople who are not usually physically active should slowly increase the amount of exercise that they do and gradually increase its intensity. This approach is the most sustainable way to ensure that regular exercise becomes a part of their lifestyle.\r\n\r\nIn the same way that recording meals can psychologically help with weight loss, people may also benefit from keeping track of their physical activity. Many free mobile apps are available that track a person’s calorie balance after they log their food intake and exercise.\r\n\r\nIf the thought of a full workout seems intimidating to someone who is new to exercise, they can begin by doing the following activities to increase their exercise levels:\r\n\r\n- taking the stairs\r\n- raking leaves\r\n- walking a dog\r\n- gardening\r\n- dancing\r\n- playing outdoor games\r\n- parking farther away from a building entrance\r\n\r\nIndividuals who have a low risk of coronary heart disease are unlikely to require medical assessment ahead of starting an exercise regimen.\r\n\r\nHowever, prior medical evaluation may be advisable for some people, including those with diabetes. Anyone who is unsure about safe levels of exercise should speak to a healthcare professional.\r\n\r\n4. Eliminate liquid calories\r\nIt is possible to consume hundreds of calories a day by drinking sugar-sweetened soda, tea, juice, or alcohol. These are known as “empty calories” because they provide extra energy content without offering any nutritional benefits.\r\n\r\nUnless a person is consuming a smoothie to replace a meal, they should aim to stick to water or unsweetened tea and coffee. Adding a splash of fresh lemon or orange to water can provide flavor.\r\n\r\nAvoid mistaking dehydration for hunger. An individual can often satisfy feelings of hunger between scheduled meal times with a drink of water.', '0', '2022-03-29 10:18:35', '2022-03-29 12:41:21'),
(286, 25, '5 Ways to Prepare for Your Sports Season', '1648549347sport-equipment-concept_1284-13034.jpg', 'Here are some ways to help you get ready for the first day:\r\n\r\n1) Get in shape. Being in shape will help you have an easier start to your sport season. Start by writing down an exercise plan. If you\'re having trouble coming up with a plan or workouts, ask your coach, gym teacher, or trainer for advice. If you can\'t make it to a gym or don\'t have a lot of time, there are lots of exercise apps and online workouts you can try at home.\r\n\r\nWrite down your goals for the week and the workouts you plan to do. Schedule specific workout times. This will help you stay motivated and stick to your exercise plan. It will also help you keep track of what activities you did. If you liked a certain workout, make a note next to it so you can repeat it another week.\r\n\r\n2) Set realistic goals. While you get ready for the start of your sports season, think of what you want to achieve. Your goals may be general, like making the team or getting in shape. But smaller, specific goals are easier to achieve and can build toward your bigger goal. Be sure to write down your goals and discuss them with your parent or coach — they can support you. If you reach your goal, set new goals to work toward. Having goals can be a great motivator!\r\n\r\n3) Check your gear. If you\'re returning to your sport, try on your equipment to make sure it still fits and works for you. If you\'re new to a sport, ask your coach what you\'ll need. You can buy your gear secondhand or borrow it from siblings or friends to save money. Make sure all your gear is clean and safe to use. If you\'re unsure, ask your coach to look at it before the first day of practice.\r\n\r\n4) Consider a sports camp. Sports camps help new and experienced players practice skills before the season starts. College players, coaches, or other professionals usually teach the camps.

Scrimmages also can help you get the feel of playing on a team if it\'s something you\'re not used to. Many schools and colleges offer sports camps and clinics during the summer and on the weekends during the school year.\r\n\r\n5)  See your doctor. Your school or team will need you to get a sports physical before allowing you to try out or play. Because everyone needs to get checked to play, doctors are busiest at the beginning of sports seasons.\r\n\r\nAsk your mom or dad to set up an appointment before your season starts. That gives the doctor plenty of time to fill out your paperwork so you can start your sport on time. If you wear glasses, consider visiting your eye doctor to check your prescription and get the right protective eyewear.\r\nWhether you\'re training with a team or on your own, remember to include rest time into your schedule. Make sure you take at least 1–2 days off per week from competitive sports and training. Take at least 2 months off each year from any particular sport to prevent repetitive stress injuries.', '0', '2022-03-29 10:22:27', NULL),

While it is being told that the performance would be rewarded and these leaders were being given a chance to show their mettle, many feel that loyalty should also be a point for consideration,” a senior party leader said.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso Read |Eight-time BJP MLA Mahana elected UP Assembly Speaker unanimously\r\nParty sources said the idea behind giving important portfolios to new faces was to send a message that no post or recognition is permanent and therefore performance would be considered the top priority.\r\n\r\n Deputy CM Brajesh Pathak at Vidhan Bhavan, on Tuesday. (PTI)\r\nWhile Keshav Prasad Maurya, who lost in the Assembly polls from Sirathu, has been retained as deputy chief minister, he has not been given the significant Public Works Department (PWD) that he held in the last Cabinet. Instead, the PWD portfolio has gone to Jitin Prasada, who quit the Congress to join the BJP ahead of the polls. Prasada was a minister in the Congress-led UPA government at the Centre.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, Maurya’s colleague — Brajesh Pathak — who has been elevated to the Deputy CM’s post has been allotted four significant departments – Medical and Health, Family Welfare, Maternal and Child Welfare as well as Medical Education.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ministries related to health has gained significance post the Covid pandemic. Interestingly, during the pandemic, Pathak was among a few BJP leaders and ministers, who had questioned his own government about the Covid preparedness.\r\n\r\nAnother ministry that has gained prominence following the pandemic is urban employment and poverty alleviation, which has been given to another newcomer AK Sharma. With experience in handling infrastructure projects as an IAS officer, the former Gujarat-cadre officer is expected to not just bring his expertise but also act as a link between the Centre and the state as these ministries require coordination for central funds.\r\n\r\nAlso, the significant MSME Ministry has been given to Rakesh Sachan, who joined the BJP just before the polls. Sachan has previously been with the Samajwadi Party and Congress. In the first term of the Adityanath government, the MSME Ministry was with Sidharth Nath Singh, who has been dropped this time. Sachan has also been allotted Khadi, handloom and textile departments.\r\n\r\nAnother BJP leader, considered a “non-cadre” – Nand Gopal Nandi, has been given Infrastructure and Industrial Development Department, Export promotion, Investment promotion as well as NRI Ministry. The portfolio was earlier with senior party leader Satish Mahana in the previous Cabinet.\r\n\r\nJaiveer Singh, also considered a “non-cadre” party leader, has been given the much significant Tourism and Culture Department, which has a significant responsibility to speed up projects, especially in the development of infrastructure around religious towns of Ayodhya, Mathura, Kashi and Prayagraj.\r\n\r\nSimilarly among MoS (Independent charge), the highest revenue generating ministry — Excise & Prohibition — has been given to former SP leader Nitin Agrawal, who later joined BJP.', '0', '2022-03-30 08:36:39', NULL),

The new policy facilitates manufacturing of liquor and wine from locally available fruits, opening up of new retail outlets and permitting liquor licence at IT parks.\r\n\r\nBy giving licence to manufacture fruit-based, low-alcohol content beverages, the government wants to give a major fillip to the cultivation of banana, pineapple, jackfruit, cashew and nutmeg in the state. Besides, the decision to permit bars at IT parks is envisaged to increase facilities at the premises, government sources said.\r\n\r\nAs per the new policy, the state-run liquor retailer, BEVCO, would be allowed to open more outlets across Kerala. At present, the state has only 306 liquor retail outlets. The high court had several times pulled up the BEVCO to reduce the rush at these outlets and provide better facilities to the consumers. Accordingly, the new outlets would have walk-in facilities for consumers. The BEVCO has demanded 175 new outlets, but the final figure on new shops would be decided later. While selecting new locations for the outlets, preference would be given to tourism hubs.\r\n\r\nThe new liquor policy, which would increase the availability of alcohol in Kerala, goes against the earlier professed stand of the CPI(M)-led LDF. In the election manifestos of 2016 and 2021, the LDF had promised steps to bring down the consumption of liquor through enlightenment and campaign drives. However, the ruling party had specifically stated that it does not want a total prohibition.\r\n\r\nIn 2017, a year after the previous CPI(M) regime assumed office, the LDF had reversed the erstwhile Congress government’s (2011-2016) liquor policy, which envisaged total prohibition by 2025. Then, the LDF unveiled a new liquor policy that allows sale of Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) in hotels having three and four-star classifications. During the previous Congress regime, sale of IMFL was restricted to four- and five-star hotels, leaving the tourism and hotel industry in crisis. The reversal of the policy by the LDF in 2017 had led to the revival of the sector in Kerala.\r\n\r\nThe previous Congress government had also closed down several retail outlets as part of its policy to bring in prohibition in a phased manner. A chunk of these closed outlets would be reopened as part of the new policy for the 2022-23 fiscal year.\r\n\r\nThe previous LDF government also gave 250 new bar licences and 99 beer/wine parlour licences in Kerala, disregarding the protest from the Opposition parties and anti-liquor movements.\r\n\r\nAs per the state excise department data, the number of liquor outlets is low in Kerala compared to other states.

If you are new to the world of workouts, please do not try these variations directly,” the expert warns.\r\n\r\n1. Explosive push-ups\r\nThis variation is a game-changer when it comes to developing extreme pushing strength making your tricep, chest, and shoulder muscles stronger. All you have to do is go as low as your bent elbows, and then push yourself up as much as possible, so that your hands fly from the ground and you lift your entire body except for your toes. Your whole upper body would be in a flying position. Remember to land softly in the same position for one more count. Ensure that you do it in the right position to avoid injury.\r\n\r\n2. Full flying push-ups\r\n\r\nThis is a more advanced variation of explosive push-up. Follow the same steps as mentioned above, but lift both your hand and feet from the ground while you push yourself upwards. Not only your upper body, but the entire body will be in the air. This variation helps in building more dynamic power. You can also try to clap your hands and feet while in the air for a modulation if you can hold more airtime.\r\n\r\n3. Spiderman push-ups\r\n\r\nGet yourself into the regular push-up position and while you go down, bring one leg in the Spiderman position with your knees bent externally outward till your hips. They help in developing more strength if you are trying to do a one-arm push-up and help enhance your core strength as only one foot is on the ground while the other is being bent, squeezing the core muscles.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind to never try these variations if you are a beginner; there are several beginner-friendly variations such as wall push-ups, knee push-ups. You can try those and gradually move to standard push-ups, master it, and then try these above-mentioned variations, Thakkar concludes.', '0', '2022-03-30 12:37:57', NULL),

Some parts of India experience extreme summers which causes problems like dehydration, heat strokes, heat cramps, exhaustion, and more. Additionally, summer also leaves its marks on the skin if not taken extra care of.\r\n\r\nWhile the basics of cleansing, toning, moisturising, and applying sunscreen are important for all seasons, there are some dietary changes you can make to help your skin feel and look healthy, hydrated, and acne-free. “It’s important to have the right diet or rather make some diet tweaks according to the season you’re in.

To take care of proper acclimitisation, diet changes are very important,” said Deepti Khatuja, Head Clinical Nutritionist, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurgaon. “The most common example is increased hydration during summer because the loss of fluid, along with micronutrients like sodium, can lead to fatigue and cramps,” she added.\r\n\r\nWhat should you add to your diet during summers?\r\n\r\nDr Shetty stressed on increasing the hydration levels during seasonal change, which can be aided with certain food items. She suggested mangoes, which are rich in Vitamin A and beta carotenes, along with melons of all kinds as they are not only packed with vitamins and antioxidants, but is also high in its water content.\r\n\r\nKhatuja reminded that hydration should be taken care of, but “not with packaged beverages and juices which are high in sugar and preservatives.” Instead, she suggested having normal lemon water, ORS, lassi, coconut water, curd, buttermilk which are good “for maintaining sodium, potassium levels that we lose during summers.” These not only help keep the skin hydrated but also remove toxins.\r\n\r\nALSO READ |Three pulses you must add to your summer diet\r\nShe said that bel, or wood apple, too, is high in vitamin A and beta carotene, and provides coolness. “It can be consumed in smoothies and sharbats which do not have added artificial sweeteners.” Another easily available, desi food item is sattu which is widely consumed in India during the summers for  its cooling effect.

Here’s what experts say', '1648644274man.jpg', 'Seasonal fruits are known to be extremely healthy as they help fight infections and illnesses that weaken immunity. Therefore, experts suggest consuming them regularly. And as summer intensifies, two new studies have indicated that consuming mangoes can help better one’s overall health by controlling blood glucose, and also preventing chronic conditions of the kidney, along with other lifestyle disorders .\r\n\r\nWhile mangoes, nicknamed the king of fruits, are often advised to be avoided by diabetics, regular consumption can help avoid chronic disease complications, mentioned the studies published in Nutrients and Nutrition, Metabolism and Cardiovascular Diseases.\r\n\r\nAlso Read |7 health benefits of eating delicious, JUICY mangoes in summers\r\nAccording to the study published in Nutrients, regular mango consumption was associated with positive outcomes in nutrient intakes, diet quality, and weight. The study used United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001-2018 data to compare the diets and nutrient intakes of mango consumers to people who did not consume mangoes.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt further indicated that children who regularly consumed mango had higher intakes of immune-boosting vitamins A, C and B6, as well as fibre and potassium. The study also showed similar results in adults with regular consumption associated with reduced intake of sugar and sodium.\r\n\r\n“We have known for a long time that there is a strong correlation between diet and chronic disease,” said Yanni Papanikolaou, a researcher on the study. “This study reveals that both children and adults eating mangoes tend to have significantly better diet quality overall along with higher intakes of fibre and potassium compared with those who don’t eat mangoes. It is also important that mango fits into many diverse cuisines. Whole fruits are under-consumed, and mango can encourage fruit consumption, especially among growing diverse populations.”\r\n\r\nAnother study published in Nutrition, Metabolism and Cardiovascular Diseases indicated that snacking on mangoes is associated with better glucose control and lower inflammation in the body.\r\n\r\nAlso Read |Focus on your diet to tackle chronic inflammation; here’s how\r\nTwenty seven adults who were overweight or obese based on Body Mass Index (BMI), but reported no known health conditions, participated in the study. They were given either mango or low-fat cookies as a snack while maintaining their usual diet and physical activity levels for 12 weeks, and after a four-week wash-out period, the alternating snack was given for another 12 weeks. Researchers measured the effects on glucose, insulin, lipid profiles, liver function enzymes and inflammation. At the end of the trial period, findings indicated that mango consumption improved glycemic control (an individual’s ability to manage blood glucose levels, an important factor in preventing and managing diabetes), and reduced inflammation.\r\n\r\nmangoes, mangoes fat content, do mangoes make you fat, fat content in mangoes, indianexpress.com, indianexpress, pooja makhija, pooja makhija instagram, Do you like having mangoes? (Source: Pixabay)\r\nWhile there was no drop in blood glucose when participants snacked on low-fat cookies, the results showed that with snacking on mangoes, there was statistically significant (p= 0.004) decrease in blood glucose levels at four weeks and again at 12 weeks, even though there was twice as much sugar, naturally occurring, in the mangoes compared to the cookies. The study noted that there was statistically significant improvements to inflammation markers, total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and C-reactive protein (CRP), when snacking on mangoes.\r\n\r\nTAC is an indication of antioxidant capacity or how well foods prevent oxidation in cells. CRP helps measure inflammation in the body. The study suggested that mangoes are abundant in antioxidants that offered protection against inflammation compared to the cookies.\r\n\r\nHealth benefits of mangoes:\r\n\r\nIn many of her videos, celebrity nutritionist Rujuta Diwekar has pointed out the need to eat local, seasonal and fresh. And mangoes tick mark all these categories besides having other health benefits.\r\n\r\nAccording to Rujuta, one must consume mangoes for three basic reasons:\r\na) They are local fruits\r\n) They are in season\r\nc) They are genetically compliant with our bodies: “You can consume mangoes in the form of pickle, aamras, panna or simply eat the slices,” says Rujuta. Since mangoes are something we have grown up eating, it cannot do any harm to our body.\r\n\r\n“Moreover, the potassium and magnesium in mangoes allow the body to maintain a steady pulse and keep the blood vessels relaxed. Mangoes are also loaded with mangiferin, which protects the heart cells against getting inflamed. The magical fruit contains vitamin A that improves vision and reduces dry eye symptoms,” Dr Jinal Patel, dietitian, Apollo Spectra Hospital, Mumba told indianexpress.com.\r\n\r\nAlso Read |Simple tips and tricks to keep in mind while purchasing mangoes\r\nRujuta listed down the following nutrients in mangoes, that make it “perfectly okay” for diabetics and weight-watchers to eat it:\r\n\r\nBeta-carotene: A nutrient found especially in yellow foods, beta-carotene helps give a flawless complexion.\r\nVitamin C: “This will help your bones and joints”\r\nFibre: Since fruit fiber is good for our digestive tract, eating mangoes will sort out your worries concerning constipation. Along with this, mangoes will help in reducing your cholesterol.\r\nVitamin B6: Won’t make you feel bloated when you get up in the morning or late in the evening.\r\n\r\nCan diabetics have one mango a day?\r\n\r\nAccording to Rujuta, mangoes are excellent for diabetics and  in fact, “one mango everyday will help diabetics”. Since mangoes are rich in antioxidants and fibre, it helps with insulin sensitivity which in turn helps regulate blood sugar levels.\r\n\r\nDr Patel explained that the fruit which is rich in fibre, eases digestion, and keeps stomach problems at bay, is high in vitamin C and carotenoids that can help prevent the onset of diabetes. “Mango is high in sugar but eating it in the quantity recommended by the expert will help control high blood sugar levels as it contains fibre and protein. The fruit is also rich in vitamin A and helps with a robust immune system by cutting down the risk of infections,” said Dr Patel.\r\n\r\n“A mango serving size should be around ¾ cup of mango slices, which is around 50-60 calories — making it an ideal light snack. ¾ cup of mango provides 50 per cent of your daily vitamin C, eight per cent of your daily vitamin A, and eight per cent of your daily vitamin B6,” said Preety Tyagi, lead health coach, nutritionist, and founder of MY22BMI.', '0', '2022-03-30 12:44:34', NULL),

It was hosted virtually by Sri Lanka, the current chair of the regional grouping.\r\n\r\nModi said India would provide $1 million in aid to augment the budget of the Bimstec secretariat. “Recent developments in Europe have raised question marks over the stability of international order,” he said. “In this context, it has become important to make Bimstec regional cooperation more active,” he said, adding that “regional security is very important now”.\r\n\r\n\r\nModi said that in order to increase mutual trade among Bimstec nations, it was important to move forward on the free trade agreement proposal. “With our region facing challenges of health and economic security, the need of the hour is unity and cooperation,” he said. “Today is the time to make the Bay of Bengal bridge of connectivity, bridge of prosperity, bridge of security,” he said.\r\n\r\nBesides India, Bimstec comprises Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Nepal and Bhutan.\r\n\r\nThe summit will adopt the “Bimstec charter”, which will give the grouping an international identity, formally state its purposes and principles and lay out a basic institutional architecture for it, officials said.\r\n\r\nWith 21.7 per cent of the world’s population and combined GDP of $3.8 trillion, Bimstec has emerged as an influential engine of economic growth.\r\n\r\nThe theme of the Colombo summit is “Bimstec-Towards a Resilient Region, Prosperous Economies, Healthy Peoples”. The theme of the previous summit, held in Kathmandu in August 2018, was “Towards a Peaceful, Prosperous and Sustainable Bay of Bengal Region”.

As is the normal practice at the end of the summit, the current chair will hand over chairmanship to Thailand.\r\n\r\nIndia’s efforts to develop a platform for countries in the Bay of Bengal region began in June 1997 with the establishment of the ‘BIST-EC’ grouping (Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka and Thailand Economic Cooperation).

The practice of holding summit meetings began in July 2005 in Bangkok. In 2014, following a decision taken at the third summit in Nay Pyi Taw, a Bimstec secretariat was established in Dhaka the same year. In 2021, Bimstec foreign ministers approved a reorganisation of the grouping’s activities into seven principal areas with each member taking the lead of one sector: trade, innovation and development (Bangladesh); environment and climate change (Bhutan); security (India); agriculture and food security (Myanmar); people-to-people contacts (Nepal); science, technology and innovation (Sri Lanka); and connectivity (Thailand).\r\n\r\nBecause this will also be Bimstec’s 25th anniversary and the charter is expected to be finalised, developing the platform further will likely be an important element in the summit’s context.', '0', '2022-03-30 12:51:39', NULL);
